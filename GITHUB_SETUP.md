# GitHub Setup for Email Notification API

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your local machine
- Node.js and npm installed

## Steps to Deploy to GitHub

### 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Log in to your GitHub account
2. Click on the '+' icon in the top right corner and select 'New repository'
3. Name your repository (e.g., "email-notification-api")
4. Add a description (optional)
5. Choose whether to make the repository public or private
6. Do not initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license as we'll push the existing code
7. Click 'Create repository'

### 2. Initialize Git in Your Local Project

```bash
cd path/to/email-notification-api
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### 3. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your repository name:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

For security reasons, the `.env` file is not included in the repository. You'll need to set up environment variables on your deployment platform.

#### For Local Development

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### For Production Deployment

If you're using a hosting service like Heroku, Vercel, or Railway, you'll need to set up environment variables in their dashboard.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

You can set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

### Example GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a file at `.github/workflows/node.js.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '16.x'
        cache: 'npm'
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm test
```

## Deployment Options

### Heroku

1. Create a Heroku account and install the Heroku CLI
2. Create a new Heroku app: `heroku create your-app-name`
3. Set environment variables: `heroku config:set SMTP_HOST=your-smtp-host ...`
4. Deploy: `git push heroku main`

### Vercel

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Run `vercel` and follow the prompts
3. Set environment variables in the Vercel dashboard

### Railway

1. Create a Railway account
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Set environment variables in the Railway dashboard

## Security Considerations

- Never commit sensitive information like API keys or passwords to your repository
- Use environment variables for all sensitive information
- Consider using GitHub Secrets for CI/CD workflows
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
